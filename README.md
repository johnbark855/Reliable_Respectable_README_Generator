# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator


## My assignment


My assignment is to create a README generator that includes what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This 
README generator uses both user input and the [Inquirer package] to make a professional, understandable README.


Technologies used:
-HTML
-NODE JS

## User Story
```md
As a developer, I want a README generator
--So I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
When I use the README generator and answer the corresponding questions
-The generator creates a README file based on the information of the project
When I specify a license
-The generator includes both a link and badge for the correct license
When I specify my github and email
-The generator will provide this information as well
If I leave a section blank
-the generator will notify you to insert valid data
When I am completely finished with the questions
-The generator will have all the information inserted into a new README.md file
When I use the table of contents on the README file
-The links will redirect you to the desired section
When I use the github and email links
-The links will work and direct you to the appropiate linked sources
```
Here is a screenshot of a demo generated README.md file:
